# <Norgard-Portfolio>
## Description
This is my portfolio that showcases the things I've learned in my coding bootcamp. This is the first phase of my portfolio and it contains many placeholders for the time being, as I learn new things I plan to make adjustments and make new projects.

## Usage
Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
