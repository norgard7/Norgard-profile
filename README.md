# <Norgard-Portfolio>
## Description
This is my portfolio that showcases the things I've learned in my coding bootcamp. This is the first phase of my portfolio and it contains many placeholders for the time being, as I learn new things I plan to make adjustments and make new projects.

## Usage
This portfolio page is intented to showcase the projects created: LED WALL, CALCULATOR, SURF REPORT, PASTEL PUZZLE AND RUN BUDDY. Please note that all these projects currently go to the google homepage instead of the projects. As the projects are created they will have working anchors.
